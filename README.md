# Wireshark Packet Capture and Analysis (Task 5)

## üéØ Objective
Capture live network packets using Wireshark, identify at least 3 protocols, and summarize the findings.

---

## üõ† Tools
- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) (Free and Open Source)

---

## üìå Steps

### 1. Install Wireshark
- Download and install from the official website.
- Run it with administrator privileges.

### 2. Start a Capture
- Open Wireshark.
- Select your active network interface (usually Wi-Fi or Ethernet).
- Click the blue **shark fin** icon to start capturing.

### 3. Generate Network Traffic
- Open a web browser and visit a website.
- Or, run a simple command in terminal:
  ```bash
  ping google.com
  ```
- Let it run for about a minute.

### 4. Stop Capture
- Click the **red square** button to stop.

### 5. Apply Filters
- HTTP traffic:  
  ```
  http
  ```
- DNS traffic:  
  ```
  dns
  ```
- TCP traffic:  
  ```
  tcp
  ```

### 6. Export the Capture
- Go to **File > Save As...**
- Save the file as `sample_capture.pcap`.

### 7. Summarize Findings
- Identify at least 3 protocols (e.g., HTTP, DNS, TCP).
- Note down:
  - Source & destination IPs
  - Ports used
  - Basic description of the protocol‚Äôs role

---

## üìÅ Deliverables
- `captures/sample_capture.pcap`
- `screenshots/` (showing your filters and captures)
- `report.md` (summary of protocols and details)

---

## ‚ùì Interview Prep
Some common questions:
1. What is Wireshark used for?
2. What is a packet?
3. How to filter packets in Wireshark?
4. Difference between TCP and UDP?
5. What is a DNS query packet?
6. How can packet capture help in troubleshooting?
7. What is a protocol?
8. Can Wireshark decrypt encrypted traffic?

## ‚úÖ Outcome
By completing this task, you‚Äôll gain:
- Hands-on packet analysis skills
- Awareness of network protocols
- Confidence in using Wireshark for troubleshooting
